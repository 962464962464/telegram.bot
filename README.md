This package features a number of tools to make the development of Telegram bots with R easy and straightforward.
It is an extension of the 
[`telegram`](https://github.com/lbraglia/telegram) package, an R wrapper around the
[Telegram Bot API](http://core.telegram.org/bots/api); and it is inspired by Python's submodule `telegram.ext` from
[`python-telegram-bot`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) library.

## Installing

You can download the `telegram.ext` developers version with:

```r
