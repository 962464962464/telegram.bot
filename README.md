# telegram.ext

> Building a Telegram Bot with R

This package features a number of tools to make the development of Telegram bots with R easy and straightforward.
It is an extension of the 
[`telegram`](https://github.com/lbraglia/telegram) package, an R wrapper around the
[Telegram Bot API](http://core.telegram.org/bots/api); and it is inspired by Python's submodule `telegram.ext` from the
[`python-telegram-bot`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) library.

## Installing

It is compatible with `telegram` package's version [`0.6.2-dev`](https://github.com/ebeneditos/telegram), which allows the use of Long Polling.
This version is being revised in order to update the stable version, so for the moment you can download its developers version with:

```r
devtools::install_github('ebeneditos/telegram')
```

Then you can download the `telegram.ext` developers version:

```r
devtools::install_github('ebeneditos/telegram.ext')
```

Make sure you have the `devtools` package updated.
